Offset Codebook Mode of Operation for 128-bit Block Ciphers

Two U.S. patents were issued for OCB mode, but a special exemption allows for its use in certain cases, including software licensed under the GNU General Public License and non-commercial, non-governmental applications. However, this exemption has hindered approval by the National Institute of Standards and Technology.

Since the authors only applied for patent protection in the U.S., the algorithm is free to use in software developed and sold outside the U.S.

In January 2013, the author granted a free license for any open source license certified by the Open Source Initiative.

The U.S. patents were intentionally abandoned in 2021.
